# Inspace-Object-Detection and Tracking

●	The project aims at detecting objects that are essential on a daily basis for any end-user be it in a domestic space or a commercial space.

●	The business solution is to provide the user with info on the location of the objects that the user wants to track so that the users can save time by avoiding stressful manual search.

●	The goal of this capstone is to build Single Shot Multi-Box Detectors using state-of-the-art pre-trained models and compare their performance on the basis of mean Average Precision(mAP), mean Average Recall (mAR) and Inference speed.

#### Conclusions

Performing multiple comparisons between the state of the art architectures we found that SSD MobileNet v2 320x320 and SSD ResNet50 V1 FPN 640x640 (RetinaNet50) models have shown better results with mAP of  0.763 and 0.749, mAR values of 0.833 and 0.84 respectively. The inference speed was high for SSD MobileNet v2 320x320 with a value of 24.2 ms.
